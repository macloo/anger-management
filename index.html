  <h1>Step 1: Digital Anger Room</h1>

  <div id="angerClick">
  <h3>Release your anger without actually breaking anything in this digital anger room. What is an <b><i>anger room?</i></b></h3>

  </div>

  <div id="angerRoom">

    <p>You're pissed off. Angry. Furious. You want to blow off steam, maybe even break something. Expressing your anger can be a good thing.</p>

      <p>“Repressed anger produces all sorts of problems,” says clinical psychologist Scott Bea, PsyD. “It can contribute to physiological symptoms, or psychological symptoms like anxiety. The way in which we manage anger is significant.”</p>

      <p>Anger rooms have become all the rage for the high-strung person who needs a "safe space" to blow off some steam.Instead of destroying -- and repairing or replacing -- stuff at home or working to find the answer, there are businesses where, for a fee, you can wreak as much havoc as you want with no consequences. With prices ranging from $20 to $90, visitors are armed with the instrument of their choice -- including a baseball bat, a crowbar or a sledgehammer -- and may pick items or bring their own. Next, simply blast your favorite music and start breaking.</p>

  <h1>Step 2: Breathing Room</h1>

  <p>Relax and practice strategic breathing to calm your nerves. What is the <b><i>4-7-8 Breathing Technique?</i></b>
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="breathingRoom">

    <p>Breathing techniques are designed to bring the body into a state of deep relaxation. Specific patterns that involve holding the breath for a period of time allow your body to replenish its oxygen. From the lungs outward, techniques like 4-7-8 can give your organs and tissues a much-needed oxygen boost.</p>

    <p>The 4-7-8 breathing technique is a great way to relieve one's feeling of anger as it puts the practitioner in a relaxed state almost immediately. The 4-7-8 breathing technique is takes almost no time and requires no equipment.</p>

    <p>Sit with your back straight and place the tip of your tongue against the ridge of tissue just behind your upper front teeth.</p>

    <p><b>4-7-8 Instructions:</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds</li>
        <li>Hold your breath for 7 seconds</li>
        <li>Exhale through your mounth for 8 seconds</li>
        <li>Repeat 3 times</li>
      </ol>

    <p>A recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28954895" target="_blank">study</a> showed that controlling breathing by counting breaths influences “neuronal oscillations throughout the brain,” particularly in brain regions related to emotion.  Participants were asked to count how many breaths they took over a two-minute period, which caused them to pay especially focused attention to their breathing.  When they counted correctly, brain activity (monitored by EEG) in regions related to emotion, memory and awareness showed a more organized pattern versus what’s normally experienced during a resting state. The results are preliminary, but add to the argument that controlling breathing taps into something deeper.</p>

<h1>Step 3: Music Room</h1>

  <div id= "musicClick">
    <p>Relieve your anger by listening to <b><i>calming music.</i></b>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="musicRoom">

    <p>Music can be a helpful tool in learning to manage strong emotions like anger. Listening to music is one of the easiest ways to get your dopamine flowing, which result to the feeling of calmness and relief. </p>

    <p>According to the research institute Mindlab International, which conducted a study on behalf of a bath and shower gel company, they've managed to create the most relaxing song ever, in collaboration with the musical group Marconi Union. The song, called "Weightless," has a rhythm of 60 beats per minute, which apparently results in breathing and heartbeat synchronizing and slowing, and also involves bass and "low whooshing sounds." When played to 40 women, Mindlab says, the song produces a 65 percent reduction in anxiety levels and a 35 percent reduction in physiological resting rates.</p>

    <p>If you're angry or stressed, scientists recommend nature sounds as a good way to enter a calmer space. Research from 2017 done by the University of Sussex reveals that when people are exposed to sounds from natural environments, the signals of stress and arousal in their bodies visibly reduce. Natural noises made people's brains look "outwards," listening and being aware of their environment.</p>
